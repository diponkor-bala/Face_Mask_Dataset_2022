# Face_Mask_Dataset_2022
Masks are one of the few preventative measures that can be taken against COVID-19 in the absence of immunization, so it is imperative that people wear them whenever they are in an environment where they may be exposed to respiratory infections. Using this dataset, it is possible to develop a model that can differentiate between individuals who are wearing masks and individuals who are not wearing masks. This dataset contains a total of 20,347 images belonging to the 2 classes.
